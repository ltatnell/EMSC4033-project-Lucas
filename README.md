# EMSC4033-project

This repository contains code which can do the following things;  

1. Fit an arbitrary number of orthogonal polynomials to a given set of data
2. Calculate probabilities for that fit, given the error in the data and the goodness of fit

Specifically, this code is catered towards the analysis of rare earth element (REE) patterns, and further contains code which can determine the most probable amount of orthogonal polynomials to describe data in a REE dataset.

Instructions on how to use the code are in Report and Instructions.md. A demonstration of the code working on a REE dataset can be found in Code/Code demo.ipynb
