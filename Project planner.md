# A beysian approach to rare earth elements lambda coefficients

## Executive summary

Rare earth element (REE) pattern lambda parameterisation involved deconvolution of a REE pattern into a sum of orthogonal polynomials up to the fourth degree. I aim to use a beysian approach to this to decide the appropriate degree of polynomials which is most likely to describe a given REE pattern, given the error in that pattern.

## Goals

- Write a function to generalise vieta's formula to calculate orthogonal polynomials up to the Nth degree
- Write an algorithm which obtains a probability of the model given the data for all polynomials up to degree N

## Background and Innovation  

_Give more details on the scientific problem that you are working on and how this project will advance the discipline or help with your own research.
(Where applicable, describe how people have been achieving this goal up to now, talk about existing packages, their limitations, whether you can generalise something to help other people use your code)._

## Resources & Timeline

_What do you have at your disposal already that will help the project along. Did you convince somebody else to help you ? Are there already some packages you can build upon. What makes it possible to do this project in the time available. Do you intend to continue this project in the future ?_

(For example:
  - I’ll be using data of X from satellite and then also data from baby blue seals…
  - I’ll step on existing package Y and build extra functionality on top of class W.
  - I’ll use textbook Z that describes algorithms a, b, c
  - …
)

## Testing, validation, documentation

**Note:** You need to think about how you will know your code is correct and achieves the goals that are set out above (specific tests that can be implemented automatically using, for example, the `assert` statement in python.)  It can be really helpful if those tests are also part of the documentation so that when you tell people how to do something with the code, the example you give is specifically targetted by some test code.

_Provide some specific tests with values that you can imagine `assert`ing_
